This is my competitive programming code library. There are many others like it, but this one is mine. My library is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life. Without me, my library is useless. Without my library, I am useless. I must compile my library successful. I must solve straighter than problemsetter, who is trying to challenge me. I must break problem before it breaks me. I will. Before Contest I swear this creed: my library and myself are defenders of my rating, we are the masters of problems, we are the saviors of my life. So be it, until system testing. Accepted.
